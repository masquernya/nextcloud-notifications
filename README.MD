# Nextcloud Todo Notifications

Sends push/email notifications to you once a todo item is due.

## Getting Started

Create a file called "config.json" with this in it (replace the URL):
```json
{
  "CloudUrl": "https://your-next-cloud-url.example.com"
}
```

Build and run the program, then follow the terminal instructions. You'll need a normal account as well as an admin account.
